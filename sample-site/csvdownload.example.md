Basic example

```html
const data = [
  ['name', 'age'],
  ['Ahmed', 12],
  ['John', 8]
];
<CSVDownload data={data} />
```
## Note:
> We avoid to make live examples for `CSVDownload` component, since mounting
> this component triggers the download directly.

> Please, check the next component since you can test it directly.
